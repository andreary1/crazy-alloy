Hello! Welcome to this new ambitious project that will add a lot of things to the game, such as mobs, items, biomes, dimensions, structures and more crazy and weird features. 

This is just the first part of the mod, which adds many candy related things. Since it is the first version, various textures, mobs and other things may change over time.

### Some of the current features:
- Three biomes (Sweet Forest, Jelly Bean Fields and Candy Cave)
- More than 20 mobs
- Two bosses (Gingerbread king and Ice Cream Dragon)
- Sweet Foods
- New Structures
- One dimension (portal shaped like the nether but with blocks of chocolate ice cream and you need the ice cream amulet to light it up)
- New ore (tourmaline)
- New weapons and equipment

In the future, several new themes will be added with the aim of making this mod unique, complete, fun and, of course, crazy. Also, this mod requires [GeckoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/geckolib).

Enjoy your experience!
